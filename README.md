🌍 EDA on Global Air Quality

This project analyzes worldwide air quality data through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). It explores pollutant levels (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, CO), city-wise variations, seasonal changes, and long-term trends. Visualizations highlight health risks, regional disparities, and insights into global environmental challenges.

📌 Objectives

Study global pollution levels across countries and cities.

Identify seasonal and yearly pollution patterns.

Compare pollutant concentrations with WHO safe limits.

Explore correlations among pollutants.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Key Insights
