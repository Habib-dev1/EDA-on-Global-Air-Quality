# EDA-on-Global-Air-Quality
EDA on Global Air Quality This project analyzes worldwide air quality data through Exploratory Data Analysis. It explores pollutant levels (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, CO), city-wise variations, seasonal patterns, and long-term trends. Visualizations highlight health risks, regional disparities, and insights into global environmental challenges.
